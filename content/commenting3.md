I missed writing blog for two days in a row. I'll make up for it tonight with some thoughts on random subjects. Regarding the comments, looks like firebase deprecated the 2.x projects, so I'll have to make a new comments webapp in 3.x That might take some time, but I want to get done by this weekend, otherwise I'll add the email one (I think it was #5).
