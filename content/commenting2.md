Title: Commenting part 2

I have started working on creating a simple firebase webapp for commenting. I still don't know if github pages would allow third party javascript. Lot to learn. I will give this a day or two to cook.

In other news, watched the Netflix documentary "One in a billion", and downloaded the "Born a crime" audiobook by Trevor Noah.

Also, I will just publish this blog on github from now onwards, not the whole source. Cheers!
