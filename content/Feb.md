Jan flew by so fast! I know I already broke one of my NY resolution of writing a blog everyday, but I made up for it by learning new stuff. Two things I did: Docker and Chat bots. I'll be doing some flask this weekend on PythonAnywhere, which btw is an amazing PaaS website for Python. Ultimately I want to build a chatbot I can be proud of.
